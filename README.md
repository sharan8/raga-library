# Raga Library

## Background
**What is a raga? -** A raga or raag is a melodic framework for improvisation (and composition) akin to a melodic mode in Indian classical music. [Wikipedia]

**What is a swara? -** A swara is a Sanskrit word that connotes simultaneously a breath, a vowel, and the sound of a musical note corresponding to its name. [Wikipedia]

Ragas feature heavily in carnatic and hindustani styles of music, and each raga has a distinct permutation of swaras that give it a unique character.
